## How to contribute

Feel free to make any sort of contribution or suggestion!

Please write unit tests for any functionality you add.
Follow the standards defined in the pyproject.toml.
For example, follow formatting, linting and other defined standards.
To ensure that you follow these standards, install the git hooks using `pre-commit`:
```
export PRE_COMMIT_HOME=$PWD/.venv

pre-commit install
```
