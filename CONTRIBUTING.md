## How to contribute

Feel free to make any sort of contribution or suggestion!

Please write unit tests for any functionality you add.
Make sure to install the 'test' and 'dev' dependencies defined in the pyproject.toml.
Follow standards defined in the pyproject.toml. For example, follow formatting, linting and other defined standards.

The package is in progress and in an early stage, so standards are not yet very rigid. Do your thing, and we will align during the PR review :)
